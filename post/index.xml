      <description>In my last post I talked about the calculator I had just built that needed to apply a linear model in a batch fashion to a provided dataset. In the context of single-case design, the model is applied to a single individual’s behaviors across time. What ended up in that calculator looked (kind of) like this:
dat %&amp;gt;% slice_rows(clusters) %&amp;gt;%by_slice(~model_params(dat = ., .collate = &amp;quot;cols&amp;quot;)Here, clusters is just the user-supplied set of variables that uniquely describe one individual’s data–say a study ID and a participant ID.</description>

      <description>What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in my time as a Ph.D. student is that I enjoy is facilitating other people&amp;rsquo;s work and research. I love writing R code that helps other people succeed, be it code that&amp;rsquo;s necessary to get something working for a project of my adviser&amp;rsquo;s, the code to build a function or a shiny app to make statistical methods available to researchers, or code to help someone with understanding, transforming, or analyzing their data.</description>
